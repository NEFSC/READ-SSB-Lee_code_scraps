# Code scrap repository

A small repository that contains a some scraps of code.  Some of these might be useful. Some of them are just me trying to figure out how to code something.

I didn't follow my usual convention of storing data separately from code. I'm not going to fix it.  

A few files were not committed because they are too large.  I'm not going to fix that either.
